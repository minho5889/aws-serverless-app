With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code as a ZIP file or container image, and Lambda automatically and precisely allocates compute execution power and runs your code based on the incoming request or event, for any scale of traffc. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from over 200 AWS services and SaaS applications or call it directly from any web or mobile app. You can write Lambda functions in your favorite language (Node.js, Python, Go, Java, and more) and use both serverless and container tools, such as AWS SAM or Docker CLI, to build, test, and deploy your functions.

**Benefits**

<img src="media/image7.png" style="width:6.33333in;height:2.35417in" alt="No servers to manage AWS Lambda automatically runs your code without requiring you to provision or manage infrastructure. Just write the code and upload it to Lambda either as a ZIP file or container image. Continuous scaling AWS Lambda automatically scales your application by running code in response to each event. Your code runs in parallel and processes each trigger individually, scaling precisely with the size of the workload, from a few requests per day, to hundreds of thousands per second. " />

fetch - get method (mock)

store - post method (lambda)

 

<img src="media/image8.png" style="width:6.33333in;height:2.77083in" alt="Cost optimized with millisecond metering With AWS Lambda, you only pay for the compute time you consume, so you&#39;re never paying for over-provisioned infrastructure. You are charged for every millisecond your code executes and the number of times your code is triggered. With Compute Savings Plan, you can additionally save up to 17%. Consistent performance at any scale With AWS Lambda, you can optimize your code execution time by choosing the right memory size for your function. You can also keep your functions initialized and hyper- ready to respond within double digit milliseconds by enabling Provisioned Concurrency. " />
